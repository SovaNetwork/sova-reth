# v0.0.2 - Single Node Internal Devnet, with Double Spend Protection

![Status: In Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In%20Progress-yellow)

### Description
Implement native double spend protection. This mechanism should be implemented such that evm state cannot be affected by lagging or unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions. The implementation should as best as possible should not negatively impact UX.

### Status

- [DONE] - Get access to reth's `BlockExecutionStrategyFactory`. This is needed to implement the inspector. Update reth dependanices to >v1.1.0. 
- [DONE] - Add sova cli, as a wrapper around reth cli.
- [DONE] - Add SovaNode type with builder. This is needed to create custom implementations for the execution flow and block building flow.
- [WIP] - Double spend protection - [External Service for Tracking Locks Implementation](#external-service-for-tracking-locks-implementation)

### Details

#### External Service for Tracking Locks Implementation
- sova-reth
    - Client as apart of the inspector.
        - Pass the access list to the External Service to check for active locks.
            - If revert SSTORE previous value.
            - If locked fail tx.
        - Pass an access list to the External Service to lock slots.
- External Service (gRPC)
    - Contains locked slot storage table. Table is append only where unlocking adds a row with this updated state.
        - key = contract address
        - slot index = slot to lock
        - value = UTXO information (txid, vout) + sova block that slot was locked at + previous value (incase of revert)
    - API
        - lock setting
        - checking lock status (unlocked, locked, revert). "Revert" mean change slot back to previous value.
    - Lock checking
        - Use BTC node to check UTXO confirmation status.

### Storage Slot Locking
Flagged slots will be stored within reth's internal database. We will be forking the storage crate and adding a table until we can design an approach that does not necessitate a fork. The main reasons for forking are:
- Lower level `transaction` API is private on reth's mdbx implementation. Without access to this we cannot namespace the table to our additional tables and create them.
- To take advantage of reth's database checkpointing for rolling back during reorgs.

The schema for the Storage Slot table is described below where:
Key: Storage Slot Address
Value: Lock Flag
SubKey: UTXO ID (BTC `$TXID-$VOUT-$ADDRESS` hashed)
```
table StorageSlotLocks {
    type Key = Address
    type Value = Boolean
    type SubKey = String
}
```
