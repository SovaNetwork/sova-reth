# v0.0.2 - Single Node Internal Devnet, with Double Spend Protection

![Status: In Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In%20Progress-yellow)

### Description
Implement native double spend protection. This mechanism should be implemented such that evm state cannot be affected by lagging or unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions. The implementation should as best as possible should not negatively impact UX.

### Details

- [DONE] - Update reth dependanices to >v1.1.0. Therefore we have access to the `BlockExecutionStrategyFactory`.
- [DONE] - Add sova cli, as a wrapper around reth cli
- [TODO] - Gain access to the `let builder = NodeBuilder::new(node_config).with_database(database).with_launch_context(ctx.task_executor);` to insert forked mdbx -> (`use reth_db::{init_db, DatabaseEnv};`)
- [TODO] - Fork reth_db crate and add slot saving [data structure](#storage-slot-locking)/ table(s).
- [WIP] - Use inspectors to get an access_list of all SSTORE slots touched in each tx in each block. Use call hook to see when bitcoin broadcast precompile is called. Interfaces with the revm::journaled_entries to store the flagged slots.
- [WIP] - If a slot is locked user bitcoin client to check if it can be unlocked.


### Ideas/ Current Reaserch
- Solidity keyswords to prevent locking of certain slots?
- On lock enforcement, maybe only increasing of value and not allowing decreasing?
- Current Bitcoin block number in Sova block headers?

### Storage Slot Locking
Flagged slots will be stored within reth's internal database. We will be forking the storage crate and adding a table until we can design an approach that does not necessitate a fork. The main reasons for forking are:
- Lower level `transaction` API is private on reth's mdbx implementation. Without access to this we cannot namespace the table to our additional tables and create them.
- To take advantage of reth's database checkpointing for rolling back during reorgs.

The schema for the Storage Slot table is described below where:
Key: Storage Slot Address
Value: Lock Flag
SubKey: UTXO ID (BTC `$TXID-$VOUT-$ADDRESS` hashed)
```
table StorageSlotLocks {
    type Key = Address
    type Value = Boolean
    type SubKey = String
}
```
